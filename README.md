# MScThesisPart4_TestApplication_PC_directly_to_NucleoF411
Part 4 of 4 of my MSc Thesis project. This repository contains Qt application used to test UART communication between touch panel (STM32F469 Discovery) and power converter driver (STM32F411-RE Nucleo) by sending UART commands to Nucleo board which triggers communication between the two boards. (see part 1 and 2 here on https://github.com/adamchor1992)

See screens folder for some screenshots/photos of the implemented system
